- `helmet.noCache`. If you still need it, use the `nocache` package on npm.

  - Removed support for functions as directive values. You must supply an iterable of strings

- `helmet.hidePoweredBy` no longer accepts arguments. See [this article](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet/wiki/How-to-set-a-custom-X%E2%80%93Powered%E2%80%93By-header) to see how to replicate the removed behavior. See [#224](https://github.com/helmetjs/helmet/issues/224).
